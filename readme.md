# The Tim Westwood Soundboard CLI I Didn't Know I Needed

This is a CLI version of [BBC's infamous Tim Westwood soundboard](http://web.archive.org/web/20110225040846/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/westwood/soundboard.shtml) circa 2005. I basically got drunk and tried to find it but it looks to be bricked these days, so I located the .swf, downloaded it and extracted it and got given all the assets for the original flash app.

I instantly created a simple CLI tool to relive the Tim Westwood soundboard once again.

##Usage

It's real simple tbh g

```

  npm i timsb -g   

```
```

  timsb --help   

```

Then, choose a command and hear your Tim Westwood soundbyte.
